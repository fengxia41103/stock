<h1>Backdrop</h1>
<p>The app is a complete rewrite of one which I wrote five years
ago. At the time Jookun approached me that he had some wise strategies
of investment. I was intrigued by his passion, but wanted to verify
its worth using some simulation. Thus a Django was created with Yahoo
finance daily data as the input, and some data crunch based on his
idea. Like all other ideas, I started to come up some of my own while
working on it, and gradually it let me deep down into the rabbit hole
&mdash; for the first time in my career, I had computation so intense
that it would overheat my laptop and had it shut down! I felt I was on
track of something. However, it had then been left to rot
since. Though I had tried to revive it over the years, some of the
code was done in such a complex manner that I didn't have the heart to
read it again. One impression, however, always left me with a hope,
the difficulty of obtain these free daily data. As mentioned, I
started with Yahoo data. However, it was shut down just around that
time. Later I shifted to Alpha Advantage while it was still free of
use. Well, not anymore. Soon after I switched to it, I guess it gained
enough popularity that it went on with memberships and so on. What
jumping through these hoops occurred to me that if I could just
publish these historical data somehow, and let people download and use
them, there are already value.</p>
<p>So recently, I started to think about this idea. Starting with another
round of reviving the old app, I implemented Django command to dump DB
data into CSVs, thus creating 500+ files, each representing a SP500
symbol, which were what I had. However, I want more &mdash; how about
a better user experience? how about some computation of probabilities
based on a layman's observation? how about DCF?... all these,
eventually propelled me to rewrite this from scratch, and here it is.</p>
<h1>Audience &amp; goals</h1>
<p>First, it is an absolute illusion if a beginner like myself will beat
the market by these analysis, not only because of limitation of
knowledge, information, and experience, but of personality. I don't
know what the winners are like. Internet is filled with articles on
what it takes to be a good investor. I have some of those qualities,
but there is no guarantee nonetheless. Therefore, I'm back to zero.</p>
<p>But one thing I am certain, that everyone will experience what I have
experienced, at some point of his/her life, that they are curious, or
interested in, the stock market, have the itch to try, know some bits
of it, but not a whole lot, and have some basic <strong>hunch</strong> of some
<em>pattern</em>, or <em>frequency</em>, or <em>occurance</em>, and thought there might be
a gold mine buried underneath and yourself might be the lucky one. So,
how to find out, or to verify?</p>
<p>Here are five levels of users I sense:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Type</th>
<th>Tool</th>
<th>Audience</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>1</td>
<td>apps &amp; websites</td>
<td>Have basic knowledge, satisfied with reported info</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>2</td>
<td>Excel</td>
<td>Think they have some data/info analysis edge</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>3</strong></td>
<td><strong>Excel + VBA</strong></td>
<td><strong>Automate routine computation and data assembly</strong></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>4</td>
<td>Script or lib</td>
<td>Programmer who gained more computation power over Excel</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>5</td>
<td>Commercial</td>
<td>Professional, sky is the limit, membership</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Difference between 3 &amp; 4 are blurry, but the idea is that
scripting/lib will give you a much wider selection of tools than
VBA. Further, VBA is not as good a building block if you want to stand
on the shoulder of a giant.</p>
<p>Users of type 1 and type 5 are not my audience. User of type 2,3,4 are
essentially the same people &mdash;</p>
<ul>
<li>they are independent/self-confident enough to think of their own
  method, but are yet willing to go with a commercial source or
  solution</li>
<li>they have some financial knowledge, and</li>
<li>are not afraid of (or even fond of) data crunching.</li>
</ul>
<p>Their routine follows these steps &mdash;</p>
<ol>
<li>Obtain raw data:</li>
<li>daily price (well, you could also have finer grain data)</li>
<li>financial reports: balance sheet, income statement, cash flow</li>
<li>computed ratios, eg. P/E, beta</li>
<li>some popular indicator or evaluation values</li>
<li>Crunch of his own indicator or measure using these data</li>
<li>Draw a graph here and there to visualize his results</li>
<li>Search for pattern</li>
</ol>
<p>During my research and implementation, following this pattern, I found
a few places where this tool can help:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Getting data</strong>. represented the first barrier higher than expected. I have
  related my experience w/ Yahoo, Google, Alpha. I'm surprised how
  limited such data sources are there considering how widely spread
  the Internet has become, and stock data being always in the public
  domain.</p>
<p>A value of this tool is to handle API of available data
  sources so to retrieve available <em>raw</em> data.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Cleansing data</strong>. Once you get data, consuming data represents
  another barrier &mdash; understanding particular data form (&larr;
  this is usually source dependent) and handling data anomaly.</p>
<p>2nd value of this tool is to normalize these data points, and
  potentially amending missing data by providing reasonable default.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Computing standard ratios</strong>. Crunching a clean data set is usually not the
  challenge at all.  Of course you can go with your fancy where the
  <em>edge</em> is believed to be. However, there are always a few <em>standard</em>
  ratios everyone seems to begin with, eg. growth rate of a number
  from period to period, or pcnt of one expanse of the total, things
  like that. They are not difficult to compute, but rather
  mechanical/tedious, and are not readily available from a data
  source<sup id="fnref:1"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1">1</a></sup>. Therefore, you have to do them <em>manually</em>.</p>
<p>Therefore, 3rd value of this tool is to provide some computed values
  out of box. One beauty of historical data is that they don't
  change. Therefore, a pre-calculated result is as good as new.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In short, one can view this tool as a fancy automated Excel template
that I have built to facilitate routine works and get you going w/
your analysis quickly less the mechanical build-up that is necessary
but distracting from analysis itself.</p>
<h1>System design</h1>
<figure class="col s12 center">
  <img src="images/high%20level%20design.png"/>
  <figcaption>Stock app high level design</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>System is split into backend and fronend. Backend is a Django app w/
exposed REST API using <a href="https://django-tastypie.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">Tastypie</a>. Frontend is <a href="https://reactjs.org/">React</a>.</p>
<p>Primary data source is Yahoo's financial data. In particular, I'm pulling these:</p>
<ul>
<li>historical stock daily prices &mdash; high, low, open, close, volume</li>
<li>financial statements &mdash; balance sheet, income statement, and cash flow statement</li>
<li>published meta &mdash; beta, P/E, and so on. Since these are
  opinionated, Yahoo is just one of many alternatives.</li>
</ul>
<h1>Data model</h1>
<p>Model names are intuitive.</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Name</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>MyStock</td>
<td>Place for name, symbol</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>MyStockHistorical</td>
<td>Daily trading data</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>MyStrategyValue</td>
<td>Pre-computed values based on historical, eg. moving average</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>IncomeStatement</td>
<td>As name</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>BalanceSheet</td>
<td>As name</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>CashFlow</td>
<td>As name</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>ValuationRatio</td>
<td>Published valuation ratios, eg. P/E. They are source dependent.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<h1>Data persistence &amp; processing</h1>
<p>Data persistence is MySql 5.7. Using Django's ORM, this is not a hard requirement if your preference is something else.</p>
<p>Data processing is handled by Redis via Celery so to achieve ease of scale. As mentioned earlier, <code>MyStrategeValue</code> are derived from historicals, thus are computed prehand using this mechanism: Django custom command &rarr; compose celery task &rarr; submit task to Redis queue &rarr; task executed and data is persisted to DB.</p>
<p>There are also custom model property which is computed on the
fly. Most of them can be pre-computed also since historicals are not
static. However, to minimize dependency on these values that must be
prepared as a separate step, I opted to the current method. By
observation, performance penalty by not having them in DB is
acceptable.</p>
<p>Using docker, the following data volumes are used:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Volume</th>
<th>Attach to</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>stock-data</td>
<td>Main DB data storage</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>redis-data</td>
<td>Redis data storage</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<p>Some source provide indicators such as MACD. Most, however, only
provide raw/reported data such as sales of an Income Statement. My
goal, therefore, is to follow the conventional train of thought by
converting these values into percentage, and some period-to-period
change rate, and so on, which I found myself doing a lot whenever
I receive an Excel full of numbers.&#160;<a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:1" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text">&#8617;</a></p>
