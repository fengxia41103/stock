This is a fully containerized **Django+React** web application for
data analysis hobbyist who is interested in the stock market, and uses
the Yahoo!  Finance API data.

It tries to provide analysis that are not readily available from
Google or Yahoo, but are often asked. Especially, we hope the analysis
feels more human friendly than hard numbers. For example, if a stock
drops 5% today, is this a lot? In our analysis, we will give an answer
"Last time I saw a price lower than this was 30 days ago" &mdash; "so
it has lost 30 days worth of ground"... such, we believe, help the
user to feel that data analysis and the market are fun, and
approachable.
