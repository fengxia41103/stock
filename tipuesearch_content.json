Since the analysis done to them are similar, we are to address them together here. daily return : (today's close - today's open)/today's open . This measures the return during normal market hours. nightly return : (today's open - yesterday's close)/yesterday's close . This measures the return during off market hours. 24-hour return : (today's close - yesterday's close)/yesterday's close . This measures the over effect of a 24-hour day, thus including both the market hours and off market hours (for example, many companies choose to make announcement after market close, thus causing price to fluctuate prior to next day's market opening). Stock 24-hour return chart Now with computed returns, we do some basic counting and statistic analysis of the return data. positive vs. negative occurrence This answers that out of the return data, how many were positive and how many were negative. If a stock were on a rise, we would expect it having more positive days than negative ones. However, this takes no account for the scale of each positive/negative return. Stock 24-hour return positive vs. negative occurances In this example, this stock has had 40% positive days vs. 60% negative days. One would thus think it wasn't performing well over this period. return statistics These are some common statistic values computed over the return data, including average, max, min, median, standard deviation, range of, variance, skewness, Kurtosis, average of positive returns, average of negative returns, and compounded return (= product of all returns).

Stock historical weekly price chart Gain probability Stock gain probability The gain probability is to address this common question — if I buy stock at this price, how likely I would make a positive return? percentage : The percentage measures the total likelyhood you will get a positive return counting day by day. Taking a historical, pretending we can look into the future (thus we have a God's view), counting days when you could make a gain w/ a higher price. The percentage of this count vs. the total days elapse from this date represents a probability. For example, if there are 10 days out of 30 days this one could have made a gain on this current price, the probability will be 10/30=33% . open price : This is the minimal open price you could have purchased to achieve the percentage above. Continuing the example above, if there were 10 days one could have made a positive return, we sort and display the lowest open price, thus assuming you would have paid the least for such a gain probability. A n/a means no price could have achieved such probability 1 . time window gauge : Time window is the days left if you made purchase on a day. For example, buying at $148.56 (the 30-20% probability one) would have less trading days left for you to get out, than buying at $153.87 (the 40-30% probability one). The best pattern would be a high probability and a long trading window to realize such probability. the TODAY-is-cheaper flag : The flag uses the latest known close price (as a proxy to the SPOT price) to compare with the suggested open price above. If the close is less than the open , it puts a flag indicating the current price is more attractive than the open we saw before 2 . It may now seem pointless why one would care such probability at all if it tells no future. However, these probabilities give you a reference point against current price so you get a sense of how it had (or could have) behaved. WARNING : We choose open pretending you are buying it on the beginning of day. Of course, the actual purchase price would be different. So this price value is more of a sense how well it will fare instead of being a precise point to act upon. ↩ WARNING : This is not a guaranteed winner because the stock price may be on a sliding trend, thus a lower price now doesn't warrant you would be able to realize the gain even. For example, if the close price is today's, the probability is only testifying that such price could have made gains in the past, but has no predicting power whatsoever. ↩","tags":"misc","url":"https://fengxia41103.github.io/stock/single%20stock%20price.html"},{"title":"Tmpjlksjd lfs feng","text":"Stock's price and return views are part of the stock's detail analysis.

Thus, regardless your platform, install Docker & docker-compose first. For user Clone the repo . Go to the project root folder, docker-compose up --build -d . Create a backend admin user: docker-compose run web python manage.py createsuperuser , and follow the instructions. Email is optional. Go to browser http://localhost:8084 , and use the user account to login. Now you should be ready to use the application by adding stocks and sectors. For developers Modify code Using the docker way is preferred. Code will be mounted into the docker as volume (see docker-compose.yaml for details). Thus changes done on your local editor will be reflected in the running docker as live . Debugging It may sound 1980. But the most effective way is to use docker-compose logs -f <service name> to see stack trace and/or error messages. Testing Looking for volunteers !!

We firmly believe the final conclusion should be drawn by the user whose brain power holds the edge over the market, if ever. The purpose of this tool is to assemble information in a fashion to assist the user process these information more efficiently by liberating his/her from tedious, but necessary, steps such as data collection, ratio computation, drawing a line graph, etc., than without such a helper. Thus with this tool, the user could focus onto creating value instead of being bogged down by less value-added works. Audience & goals This application is written for users who have interest in the stock market, in particular, data analysis of the stock data. In my experience, there are five levels of users: Type Tool Audience 1 apps & websites Have basic knowledge, satisfied with reported info 2 Excel Think they have some data/info analysis edge 3 Excel + VBA Automate routine computation and data assembly 4 Script or lib Programmer who gained more computation power over Excel 5 Commercial Professional, sky is the limit, membership A common pattern/workflow these users follow: Obtain raw data: daily price (well, you could also have finer grain data) financial reports: balance sheet, income statement, cash flow computed ratios, eg. P/E, beta some popular indicator or evaluation values Crunch of his own indicator or measure using these data Draw a graph here and there to visualize his results Search for pattern, signal, clue... Challenges & Values It's always easier said than done. If you echo the work pattern listed above, you would also recognize the challenges, thus the values this tool is hoping to create: Getting data Surprisingly it is rather difficult to find a free data source for stock data. For this tool, we have opted to use the Yahoo! finance API , and in particular, the yahooquery library, as the data source. If you have access to other data, the tool can be easily extended by TBD: write plugin ; A value of this tool is to handle API of available data sources so to retrieve available raw data. Cleansing data Data quality is the next challenge. By establishing a solid data model in the backend, the tool takes care of cleansing and normalizing the data before serving them for consumption. Headaches such as missing data points, divided by zero exception are handled as much as possible by the tool. 2nd value of this tool is to normalize these data points, and potentially amending missing data by providing reasonable default. Computation of ratios, percentages In stock analysis, straight-off-the-SEC-report data, such as a sales figure, is less interesting than comparisons. For example, it's less useful to know that AMZN's last reported sales was 68B than to know that the sales grew or shrank by 8% 2 over this period. Further, one can now see other questions to ask, such as whether the 8% is lower or higher than AMZN's average, or its peer's... and so on. Further, any financial book or blog has a long list of ratios calculated from reported values, and many of these ratios are not readily available by just looking at Yahoo! or Google. Therefore, they often require the user to do the computation themselves. In this tool, we have included many of the ratios, percentages, and side-by-side comparisons so to ease the pain. Therefore, 3rd value of this tool is to provide some computed values out of box. One beauty of historical data is that they don't change. Therefore, a pre-calculated result is as good as new. RESTful ready The backend readily serves a RESTful API. Thus it is ready to integrate with another toolchain of your choice. We strive to provided a good user experience w/ our frontend implementation. However, we also anticipate that needs vary. See the [API doc][] for details. System design Stock app high level design System is split into backend and fronend. Backend is a Django app w/ exposed REST API using Tastypie . Frontend is React . Primary data source is Yahoo's financial data. In particular, I'm pulling these: historical stock daily prices — high, low, open, close, volume financial statements — balance sheet, income statement, and cash flow statement published meta — beta, P/E, and so on. Since these are opinionated, Yahoo is just one of many alternatives. Data model Model names are intuitive. Name Description MyStock Place for name, symbol MyStockHistorical Daily trading data MyStrategyValue Pre-computed values based on historical, eg. moving average IncomeStatement As name BalanceSheet As name CashFlow As name ValuationRatio Published valuation ratios, eg. P/E. They are source dependent. Stock app data models Data persistence & processing Data persistence is MySql 5.7. Using Django's ORM, this is not a hard requirement if your preference is something else. Data processing is handled by Redis via Celery so to achieve ease of scale. As mentioned earlier, MyStrategeValue are derived from historicals, thus are computed prehand using this mechanism: Django custom command → compose celery task → submit task to Redis queue → task executed and data is persisted to DB. There are also custom model property which is computed on the fly. Most of them can be pre-computed also since historicals are essentially static after a day. However, to minimize dependency on these values that must be prepared as a separate step, we opted to the current method. By observation, performance penalty by not having them in DB is acceptable. Using docker, the following data volumes are used: Volume Attach to stock-data Main DB data storage redis-data Redis data storage Develop & Deployment See dev & deployment for details. Some source provide indicators such as MACD. Most, however, only provide raw/reported data such as sales of an Income Statement. My goal, therefore, is to follow the conventional train of thought by converting these values into percentage, and some period-to-period change rate, and so on, which I found myself doing a lot whenever I receive an Excel full of numbers. ↩ This is a made up example for illustration purpose. ↩","tags":"misc","url":"https://fengxia41103.github.io/stock/stock%20app%20design.html"}]}
